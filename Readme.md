Forms Has Different States Broadly Categorised as Follow:
* Value Changed (pristine, Dirty)
* Validity (valid, error)
* Visited (touched, untouched)

### Form building blocks:
* Form Control
* Form group (group of form Controls)

Form Model:
* Form Model is a Representation of HTML Form.
* Retains form state, form value, child form Control, Nested Form groups

Template Driven Forms and Reactive forms uses differen Directives.

Template Driven Forms:
* Import FormsModule
Directives:
* NgForm (To access the Form Model generated by the angular by using template Reference variable)
* NgModel (2 Way Binding)
* NgModelgroup (For grouping the input elements within the Forms)

When a Form element is added, Angular automatically assigns ngForm Directive to the Form.
NG creates Form model starting wih the Root FormGroup Instance. And binds it to the Form to track the Form value and state.
If we want to access the Form state Info, than we need to export the NGForm to a template Reference variable.

For Reactive Forms, 
Reactive FormsModule
No need of Template Reference Variable
